# Autonomous Infrastructure Health Monitoring System

## 📘 Overview

The **Autonomous Infrastructure Health Monitoring System** is a deep learning–based project that predicts and detects structural damage (such as cracks or stress failures) in real-world infrastructures like **bridges, buildings, and towers**.  

It combines **computer vision** and **time-series sensor analysis** to detect anomalies, predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of structures, and automate the entire lifecycle using **MLOps pipelines** — from data ingestion to deployment and monitoring.

This project does **not use LLMs** — it is built purely with **machine learning** and **deep learning** methods.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Infrastructure failures cost billions of dollars and pose serious safety risks worldwide.  
While IoT sensors are often installed on bridges or buildings to monitor their condition, it’s difficult to interpret and act on large volumes of data in real time.

This project aims to:
- **Detect cracks** on concrete surfaces using deep learning (CNN).  
- **Analyze vibration and temperature sensor data** to detect anomalies.  
- **Predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of structures using time-series models.  
- **Automate retraining and deployment** using a full MLOps architecture.
